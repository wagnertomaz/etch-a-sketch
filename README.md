Project for learning through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP).  

[TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is an open-source curriculum to learn full-stack web development. This is one of the projects they assign to their students: a browser‑based Etch‑a‑Sketch.

## Goal  
The main goal of this project was to apply and practice the JavaScript concepts from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) including functions, DOM manipulation, loops, and event handling by recreating the classic Etch‑a‑Sketch toy in the browser.

## Content  
This Etch-a-Sketch lets you draw on a customizable grid directly in the browser. The grid is generated dynamically with JavaScript, and you can define its size (up to 100 squares per side).  

The app includes features like:
- Drawing by hovering over grid cells.
- Erasing individual squares with an eraser mode.
- Choosing custom colors using a color picker.
- Clearing the entire board with one click.
- Creating new grids by entering the desired size.

It was a fun challenge that helped reinforce my understanding of DOM events, loops, and dynamic element creation. I also had the chance to experiment more with Flexbox and interface interaction.
